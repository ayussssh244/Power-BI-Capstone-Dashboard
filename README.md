ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest Power BI Dashboard Project! ðŸš€

In this project, I worked with a retail dataset from ShopNest, where I:

âœ… Cleaned and Transformed the Data: Utilized ETL processes to ensure the data was ready for analysis, handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.

âœ… Data Modeling: Built a robust data model connecting multiple tables, ensuring smooth relationships and optimal performance.

âœ… Custom Measures Using DAX: Created various measures like Total Sales, Average Order Value, Sales Growth, and more to derive actionable insights.

âœ… Interactive Visuals: Developed dynamic visuals including bar charts, pie charts, maps, and line graphs for a comprehensive overview.

âœ… Tooltips and Drillthrough Features: Added tooltips for additional context and enabled drillthrough for in-depth analysis, enhancing user interactivity.

âœ… Slicers for Data Filtering: Implemented slicers for seamless data filtering by category, time period, and region, empowering users to explore the data from multiple perspectives.

This dashboard addresses critical business questions such as:

ðŸ”¹ Top product categories by total sales. 
ðŸ”¹ Delayed vs. on-time order analysis. 
ðŸ”¹ Payment method distribution. 
ðŸ”¹ State-wise and seasonal sales trends.

I'm thrilled with the insights this project uncovered and the practical value it offers for retail business analysis!
